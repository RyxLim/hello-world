# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Lim Phei Hong. I like to swim, play computer games and listen to musics and songs.
I am currently taking Diploma in ICT, and very interested in programming. But, I am not doing well in programming and I do not understand a lot of things.
I heard from my friend that Github may helps me to improve, so, here I am.
